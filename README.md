# NFT-Collection-Dapp
# In this project I have created an NFT Minting and Collection Dapp.

Our Dapp first allow the user to connect it's wallet with the website.

Then firstly it checks whether the connected wallet is owner of the contract (i.e. The one who deplyed the smart contract) or not.

If it's the owner wallet then it renders a "Start Presale" Button.

When the owner clicks the button the presale starts.

In case the user is not owner then it directly renders "presale mint" or "public mint" button depending upon the time and user's wallet.

If the user has joined our whitelist then it will be able to presale mint NFTs.

Otherwise a random user can only public mint an NFT.

As users mint NFTs on our Dapp the total token Ids counter increases.

Only 20 NFts could be minted on our Dapp.
